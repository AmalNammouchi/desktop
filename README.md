# [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/desktop/desktop.svg?token=bruh3Kp8xZqr5CQ5et3q&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/desktop/desktop) [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/kstdl28ba3f7drbr/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/github-windows/desktop/branch/master)

GitHub Desktop is an open source [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)-based
GitHub app. It is written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) and
uses [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

### Linux port üêß

This is a work in progress port to Linux. My current setup:
```
üí©üëª~ $ node --version
v7.10.0
üí©üëª~ $ npm --version
4.2.0
üí©üëª~ $ python --version
Python 2.7.13
üí©üëª~ $ cat /etc/issue
Debian GNU/Linux 9
```

You need to install `libsecret-1-0` and `libsecret-1-dev`. On Debian systems:

```
$ sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-0 libsecret-1-dev
```

I haven't managed to start the app with `npm start` yet. But `npm install` and `npm run build:dev` work fine, and you can start the app with `node script/start`. There's also a small hack on script/run.js which adds the '-dev' string to the binary's path. I assume this is necessary due to my lack of knowledge of the whole Node/Electron setup, and may probably be fixed.

## Where can I get it?

Download the installer for your OS:

 - [macOS](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/darwin)
 - [Windows](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32)
 - [Windows machine-wide install](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32?format=msi)

You can install this alongside your existing GitHub Desktop for Mac or GitHub
Desktop for Windows application.

**NOTE**: there is no current migration path to import your existing
repositories into the new application - you can drag-and-drop your repositories
from disk onto the application to get started.
